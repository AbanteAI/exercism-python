# Exercism Python

This fork of exercism is for us to record the performance of Mentat across versions, models and prompts on a diverse set of python exercises. Mentat is run on this directory with this [script](https://github.com/biobootloader/mentat/blob/main/tests/benchmarks/exercism_practice_python.py) and its output is recorded in various branches.
