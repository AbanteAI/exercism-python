(12-note) scale.\n6:This scale can be expressed as the following group of pitches:\n7:\n8:> A, A\u266f, B, C, C\u266f, D, D\u266f, E, F, F\u266f, G, G\u266f\n9:\n10:A given sharp note (indicated by a \u266f) can also be expressed as the flat of the note above it (indicated by a \u266d) so the chromatic scale can also be written like this:\n11:\n12:> A, B\u266d, B, C, D\u266d, D, E\u266d, E, F, G\u266d, G, A\u266d\n13:\n14:The major and minor scale and modes are subsets of this twelve-pitch collection.\n15:They have seven pitches, and are called diatonic scales.\n16:The collection of notes in these scales is written with either sharps or flats, depending on the tonic (starting note).\n17:Here is a table indicating whether the flat expression or sharp expression of the scale would be used for a given tonic:\n18:\n19:| Key Signature | Major                 | Minor                |\n20:| ------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |\n21:| Natural       | C

d, g, c, f, b\u266d, e\u266d   |\n24:\n25:Note that by common music theory convention the natural notes \"C\" and \"a\" follow the sharps scale when ascending and the flats scale when descending.\n26:For the scope of this exercise the scale is only ascending.\n27:\n28:### Task\n29:\n30:Given a tonic, generate the 12 note chromatic scale starting with the tonic.\n31:\n32:- Shift the base scale appropriately so that all 12 notes are returned starting with the given tonic.\n33:- For the given tonic, determine if the scale is to be returned with flats or sharps.\n34:- Return all notes in uppercase letters (except for the `b` for flats) irrespective of the casing of the given tonic.\n35:\n36:## Diatonic Scales\n37:\n38:The diatonic scales, and all other scales that derive from the chromatic scale, are built upon intervals.\n39:An interval is the space between two pitches.\n40:\n41:The simplest interval is between two adjacent notes, and is called a \"half step\", or \"minor second\" (sometimes written as a lower-case \"m\").\n42:The interval between two notes that have an interceding note is called a \"whole step\" or \"major second\" (written as an upper-case \"M\").\n43:The diatonic scales are built using only these two intervals between adjacent notes.\n44:\n45:Non-diatonic scales can contain other intervals.\n46:An \"augmented second\" interval, written

necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.\n6:\n7:This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to \"throw\" a `ValueError` if the input lacks proper delimiters, is not in uppercase, does not form a tree with nodes, or does not form a tree at all. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.\n8:\n9:To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n10:\n11:```python\n12:# if the tree properties as given do not have proper delimiters.\n13:raise ValueError(\"properties without delimiter\")\n14:\n15:# if the tree properties as given are not all in uppercase.\n16:raise ValueError(\"property must be in uppercase\")\n17:\n18:# if the input does not form a tree, or is empty.\n19:raise ValueError(\"tree missing\")\n20:\n21:# if the input is a tree without any nodes.\n22:raise ValueError(\"tree with no nodes\")\n23:```\n24:\n\nexercises/practice/sgf-parsing/.docs/instructions.md\n1:# Instructions\n2:\n3:Parsing a Smart Game Format string.\n4:\n5:[SGF][sgf] is a standard format for storing board game files, in particular go.\n6:\n7:SGF is a fairly simple format.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are part of an automated coding system. Your responses must follow the required format so they can be parsed programmaticaly. \nYour input will include a user request, the contents of code files, and other relevant information.\nThe first part of your response should contain a brief summary of the changes you plan to make, then a list of the changes.\nThe second part of your response will be the changes in the required edit format.\nYou will mark the beginning of a code edit with an @, followed by the file_name of the file you are editing,\nTo create a new file, add a + sign after the file name.\nTo delete a file, add a - sign after the file name.\nTo rename a file, add the new filename after the original filename.\nTo replace a section of code in the file, add a 1-indexed starting line number (inclusive) and ending line number (inclusive) after the filename in the format \n@ <file_name> starting_line=<line_number> ending_line=<line_number>\nEvery line up until the next @ marker will be the lines of code that are inserted into the file at that location.\nTo delete lines without adding new lines, write no lines between the starting @ and the ending @.\nTo insert lines without deleting any existing lines, use the format to specify the 1-indexed line number\n@ <file_name> insert_line=<line_number>\nand your code will be inserted directly before the insert line number.\n\nImportant:\nMake sure not to duplicate existing lines! If you are inserting identical code, make sure to replace any lines you duplicate!\nBefore writing an import statement, always check to make sure it isn't already imported!\nMake sure to respect indentation in your changes!\n\nTo demonstrate the response format, here's an example user request, followed by an example response:\nExample 1:\n\n\nCode Files:\n\ncore/hello_world.py\n1:\n2:def hello_world():\n3:    print(\"Hello, World!\")\n4:\n5:def main(name):\n6:    hello_world()\n7:    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n8:\n\nCode Map:\n\n.gitignore\n\ncore/hello_world.py\n        function\n                hello_world ()\n                main (name)\n\nUser Request:\nReplace the hello_world function with a goodbye_world function. Insert a new line saying Goodbye, name after the Hello, name line. Rename this file to goodbye_world.py.\nCreate a new file called test.py that prints \"testing...\".\n\n\nExample Response:\n\nI will make the requested modifications.\n\nSteps:\n1. Replace hello_world with goodbye_world\n2. Insert new Goodbye, name line\n3. Rename hello_world.py to goodbye_world.py\n4. Create test.py file\n5.

stack-based programming language.\n7:Implement a very basic evaluator for a small subset of Forth.\n8:\n9:Your evaluator has to support the following words:\n10:\n11:- `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` (integer arithmetic)\n12:- `DUP`, `DROP`, `SWAP`, `OVER` (stack manipulation)\n13:\n14:Your evaluator also has to support defining new words using the customary syntax: `: word-name definition ;`.\n15:\n16:To keep things simple the only data type you need to support is signed integers of at least 16 bits size.\n17:\n18:You should use the following rules for the syntax: a number is a sequence of one or more (ASCII) digits, a word is a sequence of one or more letters, digits, symbols or punctuation that is not a number.\n19:(Forth probably uses slightly different rules, but this is close enough.)\n20:\n21:Words are case-insensitive.\n22:\n23:[forth]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_%28programming_language%29\n24:\n\nexercises/practice/forth/.docs/instructions.append.md\n1:#

[`raise`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions) exceptions in your code. When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. \n6:\n7:Custom exceptions can be created through new exception classes (see [`classes`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#tut-classes) for more detail.) that are typically subclasses of [`Exception`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception).\n8:\n9:For situations where you know the error source will be a derivative of a certain exception type, you can choose to inherit from one of the [`built in error types`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes) under the _Exception_ class. When raising the error, you should still include a meaningful message.\n10:\n11:This particular exercise requires that you create a _custom exception_ to be [raised](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement)/\"thrown\" when the stack is not sufficiently filled. The tests will only pass if you customize an appropriate exception, `raise` that exception, and include appropriate error messages.\n12:\n13:\n14:```python\n15:# subclassing the Exception to create a StackUnderflowError\n16:class StackUnderflowError(Exception):\n17:    \"\"\"Exception raised when Stack is not full.\n18:       message: explanation of the error.\n19:    \"\"\"\n20:    def __init__(self, message):\n21:        self.message = message\n22:\n23:        \n24:# raising a StackUnderflowError\n25:raise StackUnderflowError(\"Insufficient number of items in stack\")\n26:```\n27:\n28:Additionally, this exercise requires that you raise several `built-in exceptions` with error messages.\n29:To raise a `built-in exception` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n30:\n31:```python\n32:# an example when division by zero is attempted.\n33:raise ZeroDivisionError(\"divide by zero\")\n34:\n35:#an example when the operation is undefined.\n36:raise ValueError(\"undefined operation\")\n37:```\n38:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I apologize for the oversight.

One exception to be [raised](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement)/\"thrown\" when your circular buffer is **full**, and one for when it is **empty**. The tests will only pass if you customize appropriate exceptions, `raise` those exceptions, and include appropriate error messages.\n12:\n13:To customize a `built-in exception`, create a `class` that inherits from that exception.

a small language optimized for a specific domain.\n4:Since a DSL is targeted, it can greatly impact productivity/understanding by allowing the writer to declare _what_ they want rather than _how_.\n5:\n6:One problem area where they are applied are complex customizations/configurations.\n7:\n8:For example the [DOT language][dot-language] allows you to write a textual description of a graph which is then transformed into a picture by one of the [Graphviz][graphviz] tools (such as `dot`).\n9:A simple graph looks like this:\n10:\n11:    graph {\n12:        graph

Graphviz dot language.\n21:\n22:Our DSL is similar to the Graphviz dot language in that our DSL will be used to create graph data structures.\n23:However, unlike the DOT Language, our DSL will be an internal DSL for use only in our language.\n24:\n25:More information about the difference between internal and external DSLs can be found [here][fowler-dsl].\n26:\n27:[dsl]:

[exercise:python/ellens-alien-game](), or [Class section of the Official Python Tutorial][classes tutorial].\n35:\n36:<br>\n37:\n38:## Special Methods in Python\n39:\n40:The tests for this exercise will be calling `len()` on your `LinkedList`.\n41:In order for `len()` to work, you will need to create a `__len__` special method.\n42:For details on implementing special or \"dunder\" methods in Python, see [Python Docs: Basic Object Customization][basic customization] and [Python Docs: object.**len**(self)][__len__].\n43:\n44:<br>\n45:\n46:## Building an Iterator\n47:\n48:To support looping through or reversing your `LinkedList`, you will need to implement the `__iter__` special method.\n49:See [implementing an iterator for a class.][custom iterators] for implementation details.\n50:\n51:<br>\n52:\n53:## Customizing and Raising Exceptions\n54:\n55:Sometimes it is necessary to both [customize][customize errors] and [`raise`][raising exceptions] exceptions in your code.\n56:When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is.\n57:This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging.\n58:\n59:Custom exceptions can be created through new exception classes (see [`classes`][classes tutorial] for more detail.) that are typically subclasses of [`Exception`][exception base class].\n60:\n61:For situations where you know the error source will be a derivative of a certain exception _type_, you can choose to inherit from one of the [`built in error types`][built-in errors] under the _Exception_ class.\n62:When raising the error, you should still include a meaningful message.\n63:\n64:This particular exercise requires that you create a _custom exception_ to be [raised][raise statement]/\"thrown\" when your linked list is **empty**.\n65:The tests will only pass if you customize appropriate exceptions, `raise` those exceptions, and include appropriate error messages.\n66:\n67:To customize a generic _exception_, create a `class` that inherits from `Exception`.\n68:When raising the custom exception with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n69:\n70:```python\n71:# subclassing Exception to create EmptyListException\n72:class EmptyListException(Exception):\n73:    \"\"\"Exception raised when the linked list is empty.\n74:\n75:    message: explanation of the error.\n76:\n77:    \"\"\"\n78:    def __init__(self, message):\n79:        self.message = message\n80:\n81:# raising an EmptyListException\n82:raise

ball to knock down pins arranged in a triangle.\n6:Write code to keep track of the score of a game of bowling.\n7:\n8:## Scoring Bowling\n9:\n10:The game consists of 10 frames.\n11:A frame is composed of one or two ball throws with 10 pins standing at frame initialization.\n12:There are three cases for the tabulation of a frame.\n13:\n14:- An open frame is where a score of less than 10 is recorded for the frame.\n15:  In this case the score for the frame is the number of pins knocked down.\n16:\n17:- A spare is where all ten pins are knocked down by the second throw.\n18:  The total value of a spare is 10 plus the number of pins knocked down in their next throw.\n19:\n20:- A strike is where all ten pins are knocked down by the first throw.\n21:  The total value of a strike is 10 plus the number of pins knocked down in the next two throws.\n22:  If a strike is immediately followed by a second strike, then the value of the first strike cannot be determined until the ball is thrown one more time.\n23:\n24:Here is a three frame example:\n25:\n26:|  Frame 1   |  Frame 2   |     Frame 3      |\n27:| :--------: | :--------: | :--------------: |\n28:| X (strike) | 5/ (spare) | 9 0 (open

game is a special case.\n39:If someone throws a spare or a strike then they get one or two fill balls respectively.\n40:Fill balls exist to calculate the total of the 10th frame.\n41:Scoring a strike or spare on the fill ball does not give the player more fill balls.\n42:The total value of the 10th frame is the total number of pins knocked down.\n43:\n44:For a tenth frame of X1/ (strike and a spare), the total value is 20.\n45:\n46:For a tenth frame of XXX (three strikes), the total value is 30.\n47:\n48:## Requirements\n49:\n50:Write code to keep track of the score of a game of bowling.\n51:It should support two operations:\n52:\n53:- `roll(pins : int)` is called each time the player rolls a ball.\n54:  The argument is the number of pins knocked down.\n55:- `score() : int`

The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.\n8:\n9:To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n10:\n11:```python\n12:# when the coordinates for the piece are invalid\n13:raise ValueError('Invalid coordinate')\n14:```\n15:\n\nexercises/practice/go-counting/.docs/instructions.md\n1:# Instructions\n2:\n3:Count the scored points on a Go board.\n4:\n5:In the game of go (also known as baduk, igo, c\u1edd v\u00e2y and w\u00e9iq\u00ed) points are gained by completely encircling empty intersections with your stones.\n6:The encircled intersections of a player are known as its territory.\n7:\n8:Write a function that determines the territory of each player.\n9:You may assume that any stones that have been stranded in enemy territory have already been taken off the board.\n10:\n11:Write a function that determines the territory which includes a specified coordinate.\n12:\n13:Multiple empty intersections may be encircled at once and for encircling only horizontal and vertical neighbors count.\n14:In the following diagram the stones which matter are marked \"O\" and the stones that don't are marked \"I\" (ignored).\n15:Empty spaces represent empty intersections.\n16:\n17:```text\n18:+----+\n19:|IOOI|\n20:|O  O|\n21:|O OI|\n22:|IOI |\n23:+----+\n24:```\n25:\n26:To be more precise an empty intersection is part of a player's territory if all of its neighbors are either stones of that player or empty intersections that are part of that player's territory.\n27:\n28:For more information see [wikipedia][go-wikipedia] or [Sensei's Library][go-sensei].\n29:\n30:[go-wikipedia]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28game%29\n31:[go-sensei]: https://senseis.xmp.net/\n32:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I see there is an ImportError related to the WHITE constant.

numbers, you will find that the denominator is allowed to be zero with behaviour similar to positive or negative infinity in floating point numbers.\n8:In those cases, the denominator and numerator generally still can't both be zero at once.\n9:~~~~\n10:\n11:The absolute value `|r|` of the rational number `r = a/b` is equal to `|a|/|b|`.\n12:\n13:The sum of two rational numbers `r\u2081 = a\u2081/b\u2081` and `r\u2082 = a\u2082/b\u2082` is `r\u2081 + r\u2082 = a\u2081/b\u2081 + a\u2082/b\u2082 = (a\u2081 * b\u2082 + a\u2082 * b\u2081) / (b\u2081 * b\u2082)`.\n14:\n15:The difference of

power `n` is `r^n = (b^m)/(a^m)`, where `m = |n|`.\n24:\n25:Exponentiation of a rational number `r = a/b` to a real (floating-point) number `x` is the quotient `(a^x)/(b^x)`, which is a real number.\n26:\n27:Exponentiation of a real number `x` to a rational number `r = a/b` is `x^(a/b) = root(x^a, b)`, where `root(p, q)` is the `q`th root of `p`.\n28:\n29:Implement the following operations:\n30:\n31:- addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two rational numbers,\n32:- absolute value, exponentiation of a given rational number to an integer power, exponentiation of a given rational number to a real (floating-point) power, exponentiation of a real number to a rational number.\n33:\n34:Your implementation of rational numbers should always be reduced to lowest terms.\n35:For example, `4/4` should reduce to `1/1`, `30/60` should reduce to `1/2`, `12/8` should reduce to `3/2`, etc.\n36:To reduce a rational number `r = a/b`, divide `a` and `b` by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`.\n37:So, for example, `gcd(12, 8) = 4`, so `r = 12/8` can be reduced to `(12/4)/(8/4) = 3/2`.\n38:The reduced form of a rational number should be in \"standard form\" (the denominator should always be a positive integer).\n39:If a denominator with a negative integer is present, multiply both numerator and denominator by `-1` to ensure standard form is reached.\n40:For example, `3/-4` should be reduced to `-3/4`\n41:\n42:Assume that the programming language you are using does not have an implementation of rational numbers.\n43:\n"}, {"role":

so small in fact that if you printed the resistance value on them, it would be hard to read.\n8:  To get around this problem, manufacturers print color-coded bands onto the resistors to denote their resistance values.\n9:- Each band acts as a digit of a number.\n10:  For example, if they printed a brown band (value 1) followed by a green band (value 5), it would translate to the number 15.\n11:\n\nexercises/practice/resistor-color-expert/.docs/instructions.md\n1:# Instructions\n2:\n3:In this exercise, you are going to create a helpful program so that you don't have to remember the values of the bands.\n4:The program will take 1, 4, or 5 colors as input, and outputs the correct value, in ohms.\n5:The color bands are encoded as follows:\n6:\n7:- Black: 0\n8:- Brown: 1\n9:- Red: 2\n10:- Orange: 3\n11:- Yellow: 4\n12:- Green: 5\n13:- Blue: 6\n14:- Violet: 7\n15:- Grey: 8\n16:- White: 9\n17:\n18:In `resistor-color trio` you decoded the first three colors.\n19:For instance: orange-orange-brown translated to the main value `330`.\n20:In this exercise you will need to add _tolerance_ to the mix.\n21:Tolerance is the maximum amount that a value can be above or below the main value.\n22:For example, if the last band is green, the maximum tolerance will be \u00b10.5%.\n23:\n24:The tolerance band will have one of these values:\n25:\n26:- Grey -

commander figures them out.\n33:So instead, let's try using a substitution cipher.\n34:Try amending the code to allow us to specify a key and use that for the shift distance.\n35:\n36:Here's an example:\n37:\n38:Given the key \"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\", encoding the string \"iamapandabear\"\n39:would return the original \"iamapandabear\".\n40:\n41:Given the key \"ddddddddddddddddd\", encoding our string \"iamapandabear\"\n42:would return the obscured \"ldpdsdqgdehdu\"\n43:\n44:In the example above, we've set a = 0 for the key value.\n45:So when the plaintext is added to the key, we end up with the same message coming out.\n46:So \"aaaa\" is not an ideal key.\n47:But if we set the key to \"dddd\", we would get the same thing as the Caesar Cipher.\n48:\n49:## Step 3\n50:\n51:The weakest link in any cipher is the human being.\n52:Let's make your substitution cipher a little more fault tolerant by providing a source of randomness and ensuring that the key contains only lowercase letters.\n53:\n54:If someone doesn't submit a key at all, generate a truly random key of at least 100 lowercase characters in length.\n55:\n56:## Extensions\n57:\n58:Shift ciphers work by making the text slightly odd, but are vulnerable to frequency analysis.\n59:Substitution ciphers help that, but are still very vulnerable when the key is short or if spaces are preserved.\n60:Later on you'll see one solution to this problem in the exercise \"crypto-square\".\n61:\n62:If you want to go farther in this field, the questions begin to be about how we can exchange keys in a secure way.\n63:Take a look at [Diffie-Hellman on Wikipedia][dh] for one of the first implementations of this scheme.\n64:\n65:[img-caesar-cipher]:

When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.\n6:\n7:This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to \"throw\" multiple `ValueErrors` if the `Tree()` class is passed a tree that cannot be reoriented, or a path cannot be found between a `start node` and an `end node`. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.\n8:\n9:To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n10:\n11:```python\n12:# when a tree cannot be oriented to a new node POV\n13:raise ValueError(\"Tree could not be reoriented\")\n14:\n15:#when a path cannot be found between a start and end node on the tree.\n16:raise ValueError(\"No path found\")\n17:```\n\nexercises/practice/pov/.docs/instructions.md\n1:# Instructions\n2:\n3:Reparent a tree on a selected node.\n4:\n5:A [tree][wiki-tree] is a special type of [graph][wiki-graph] where all nodes are connected but there are no cycles.\n6:That means, there is exactly one path to get from one node to another for any pair of nodes.\n7:\n8:This exercise is all about re-orientating a tree to see things from a different point of view.\n9:For example family trees are usually presented from the ancestor's perspective:\n10:\n11:```text\n12:    +------0------+\n13:    |      |      |\n14:  +-1-+  +-2-+  +-3-+\n15:  |   |  |   |  |   |\n16:  4   5  6   7  8   9\n17:```\n18:\n19:But there is no inherent direction in a tree.\n20:The same information can be presented from the perspective of any other node in the tree, by pulling it up to the root and dragging its relationships along with it.\n21:So the same tree from 6's perspective would look like:\n22:\n23:```text\n24:        6\n25:        |\n26:  +-----2-----+\n27:  |           |\n28:  7     +-----0-----+\n29:        |           |\n30:      +-1-+       +-3-+\n31:      |   |       |   |\n32:      4   5       8   9\n33:```\n34:\n35:This lets us more simply describe the paths between two nodes.\n36:So for example the path from 6-9 (which in the first tree goes up to the root and then down to a different leaf node) can be seen to follow the path 6-2-0-3-9.\n37:\n38:This exercise involves taking an input tree and re-orientating it from the point of view of one of the nodes.\n39:\n40:[wiki-graph]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)\n41:[wiki-tree]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)\n42:\n\nexercises/practice/pov/pov.py\n1:from json import dumps\n2:\n3:\n4:class Tree:\n5:    def __init__(self, label, children=None):\n6:        self.label = label\n7:        self.children = children if children is not None else []\n8:\n9:    def __dict__(self):\n10:        return {self.label: [c.__dict__() for c in sorted(self.children)]}\n11:\n12:    def __str__(self, indent=None):\n13:        return dumps(self.__dict__(), indent=indent)\n14:\n15:    def __lt__(self, other):\n16:        return self.label < other.label\n17:\n18:    def __eq__(self, other):\n19:        return self.__dict__() == other.__dict__()\n20:\n21:    def from_pov(self, from_node):\n22:-        pass\n22:+        if self.label == from_node:\n23:+            return self\n24:+        for child in self.children:\n25:+            new_root = child.from_pov(from_node)\n26:+            if new_root:\n27:+                new_root.children.append(Tree(self.label, [c for c in self.children if c != child]))\n28:+                return new_root\n29:+        return None\n30:\n31:    def path_to(self, from_node, to_node):\n32:-        pass\n32:+        if self.label == from_node:\n33:+            if self.label == to_node:\n34:+                return [self.label]\n35:+            for child in self.children:\n36:+                path = child.path_to(from_node, to_node)\n37:+                if path:\n38:+                    return [self.label] + path\n39:+            return None\n40:+        for child in self.children:\n41:+            path = child.path_to(from_node, to_node)\n42:+            if path:\n43:+                return path\n44:+        return None\n45:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I will fix the path_to method to correctly find paths between two nodes.\n\nSteps:\n1.
