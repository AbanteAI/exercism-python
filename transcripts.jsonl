The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.\n8:\n9:To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n10:\n11:```python\n12:# if a phone number has less than 10 digits.\n13:raise ValueError(\"must not be fewer than 10 digits\")\n14:\n15:# if a phone number has more than 11 digits.\n16:raise ValueError(\"must not be greater than 11 digits\")\n17:\n18:# if a phone number has 11 digits, but starts with a number other than 1.\n19:raise ValueError(\"11 digits must start with 1\")\n20:\n21:# if a phone number has an exchange code that starts with 0.\n22:raise ValueError(\"exchange code cannot start with zero\")\n23:\n24:# if a phone number has an exchange code that starts with 1.\n25:raise ValueError(\"exchange code cannot start with one\")\n26:\n27:# if a phone number has an area code that starts with 0.\n28:raise ValueError(\"area code cannot start with zero\")\n29:\n30:# if a phone number has an area code that starts with 1.\n31:raise ValueError(\"area code cannot start with one\")\n32:\n33:# if a phone number has punctuation in place of some digits.\n34:raise ValueError(\"punctuations not permitted\")\n35:\n36:# if a phone number has letters in place of some digits.\n37:raise ValueError(\"letters not permitted\")\n38:```\n39:\n\nexercises/practice/phone-number/phone_number.py\n1:class PhoneNumber:\n2:-    def __init__(self, number):\n3:-        pass\n2:+        cleaned_number = ''.join(c for c in number if c.isdigit())\n3:+        if len(cleaned_number) == 11 and cleaned_number[0] != '1':\n4:+            raise ValueError(\"11 digits must start with 1\")\n5:+        if len(cleaned_number) != 10:\n6:+            raise ValueError(\"must not be fewer than 10 digits\")\n7:+        if cleaned_number[0] in ['0', '1']:\n8:+            raise ValueError(\"area code cannot start with zero\")\n9:+        if cleaned_number[3] in ['0', '1']:\n10:+            raise ValueError(\"exchange code cannot start with zero\")\n11:+        self.number = cleaned_number\n12:\n\nexercises/practice/phone-number/.docs/instructions.md\n1:# Instructions\n2:\n3:Clean up user-entered phone numbers so that they can be sent SMS messages.\n4:\n5:The **North American Numbering Plan (NANP)** is a telephone numbering system used by many countries in North America like the United States, Canada or Bermuda.\n6:All NANP-countries share the same international country code: `1`.\n7:\n8:NANP numbers are ten-digit numbers consisting of a three-digit Numbering Plan Area code, commonly known as _area code_, followed by a seven-digit local number.\n9:The first three digits of the local number represent the _exchange code_, followed by the unique four-digit number which is the _subscriber number_.\n10:\n11:The format is usually represented as\n12:\n13:```text\n14:(NXX)-NXX-XXXX\n15:```\n16:\n17:where `N` is any digit from 2 through 9 and `X` is any digit from 0 through 9.\n18:\n19:Your task is to clean up differently formatted telephone numbers by removing punctuation and the country code (1) if present.\n20:\n21:For example, the inputs\n22:\n23:- `+1 (613)-995-0253`\n24:- `613-995-0253`\n25:- `1 613 995 0253`\n26:- `613.995.0253`\n27:\n28:should all produce the output\n29:\n30:`6139950253`\n31:\n32:**Note:** As this exercise only deals with telephone numbers used in NANP-countries, only 1 is considered a valid country code.\n33:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I apologize for the mistake.

Files:\n\nexercises/practice/scale-generator/.docs/instructions.md\n1:# Instructions\n2:\n3:## Chromatic Scales\n4:\n5:Scales in Western music are based on the chromatic (12-note) scale.\n6:This scale can be expressed as the following group of pitches:\n7:\n8:> A, A\u266f, B, C, C\u266f, D, D\u266f, E, F, F\u266f, G, G\u266f\n9:\n10:A given sharp note (indicated by a \u266f) can also be expressed as the flat of the note above it (indicated by a \u266d) so the chromatic scale can also be written like this:\n11:\n12:> A, B\u266d, B, C, D\u266d, D, E\u266d, E, F, G\u266d, G, A\u266d\n13:\n14:The major and minor scale and modes are subsets of this twelve-pitch collection.\n15:They have seven pitches, and are called diatonic scales.\n16:The collection of notes in these scales is written with either sharps or flats, depending on the tonic (starting note).\n17:Here is a table indicating whether the flat expression or sharp expression of the scale would be used for a given tonic:\n18:\n19:| Key Signature | Major                 | Minor                |\n20:| ------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |\n21:| Natural       | C                     | a                    |\n22:| Sharp         | G, D, A, E, B, F\u266f     | e, b, f\u266f, c\u266f, g\u266f, d\u266f |\n23:| Flat          | F, B\u266d, E\u266d, A\u266d, D\u266d, G\u266d | d, g, c, f, b\u266d, e\u266d   |\n24:\n25:Note that by common music theory convention the natural notes \"C\" and \"a\" follow the sharps scale when ascending and the flats scale when descending.\n26:For the scope of this exercise the scale is only ascending.\n27:\n28:### Task\n29:\n30:Given a tonic, generate the 12 note chromatic scale starting with the tonic.\n31:\n32:- Shift the base scale appropriately so that all 12 notes are returned starting with the given tonic.\n33:- For the given tonic, determine if the scale is to be returned with flats or sharps.\n34:- Return all notes in uppercase letters (except for the `b` for flats) irrespective of the casing of the given tonic.\n35:\n36:## Diatonic Scales\n37:\n38:The diatonic scales, and all other scales that derive from the chromatic scale, are built upon intervals.\n39:An interval is the space between two pitches.\n40:\n41:The simplest interval is between two adjacent notes, and is called a \"half step\", or \"minor second\" (sometimes written as a lower-case \"m\").\n42:The interval between two notes that have an interceding note is called a \"whole step\" or \"major second\" (written as an upper-case \"M\").\n43:The diatonic scales are built using only these two intervals between adjacent notes.\n44:\n45:Non-diatonic scales can contain other intervals.\n46:An \"augmented second\" interval, written \"A\", has two interceding notes (e.g., from A to C or D\u266d to E) or a \"whole step\" plus a \"half step\".\n47:There are also smaller and larger intervals, but they will not figure into this exercise.\n48:\n49:### Task\n50:\n51:Given a tonic and a set of intervals, generate the musical scale starting with the tonic and following the specified interval pattern.\n52:\n53:This is similar to generating chromatic scales except that instead of returning 12 notes, you will return N+1 notes for N intervals.\n54:The first note is always the given tonic.\n55:Then, for each interval in the pattern, the next note is determined by starting from the previous note and skipping the number of notes indicated by the interval.\n56:\n57:For example, starting with G and using the seven intervals MMmMMMm, there would be the following eight notes:\n58:\n59:| Note | Reason                                            |\n60:| ---- | ------------------------------------------------- |\n61:| G    | Tonic

An SGF file usually contains a single\n8:tree of nodes where each node is a property list. The property list\n9:contains key value pairs, each key can only occur once but may have\n10:multiple values.\n11:\n12:The exercise will have you parse an SGF string and return a tree structure of properties.\n13:\n14:An SGF file may look like this:\n15:\n16:```text\n17:(;FF[4]C[root]SZ[19];B[aa];W[ab])\n18:```\n19:\n20:This is a tree with three nodes:\n21:\n22:- The top level node has three properties: FF\\[4\\] (key = \"FF\", value\n23:  = \"4\"), C\\[root\\](key = \"C\", value = \"root\") and SZ\\[19\\] (key =\n24:  \"SZ\", value = \"19\"). (FF indicates the version of SGF, C is a\n25:  comment and SZ is the size of the board.)\n26:  - The top level node has a single child which has a single property:\n27:    B\\[aa\\]. (Black plays on the point encoded as \"aa\", which is the\n28:    1-1 point).\n29:    - The B\\[aa\\] node has a single child which has a single property:\n30:      W\\[ab\\].\n31:\n32:As you can imagine an SGF file contains a lot of nodes with a single\n33:child, which is why there's a shorthand for it.\n34:\n35:SGF can encode variations of play. Go players do a lot of backtracking\n36:in their reviews (let's try this, doesn't work, let's try that) and SGF\n37:supports variations of play sequences. For example:\n38:\n39:```text\n40:(;FF[4](;B[aa];W[ab])(;B[dd];W[ee]))\n41:```\n42:\n43:Here the root node has two variations. The first (which by convention\n44:indicates what's actually played) is where black plays on 1-1. Black was\n45:sent this file by his teacher who pointed out a more sensible play in\n46:the second child of the root node: `B[dd]` (4-4 point, a very standard\n47:opening to take the corner).\n48:\n49:A key can have multiple values associated with it.

When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.\n6:\n7:This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to \"throw\" a `ValueError` if the input lacks proper delimiters, is not in uppercase, does not form a tree with nodes, or does not form a tree at all. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.\n8:\n9:To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n10:\n11:```python\n12:# if the tree properties as given do not have proper delimiters.\n13:raise ValueError(\"properties without delimiter\")\n14:\n15:# if the tree properties as given are not all in uppercase.\n16:raise ValueError(\"property must be in uppercase\")\n17:\n18:# if the input does not form a tree, or is empty.\n19:raise ValueError(\"tree missing\")\n20:\n21:# if the input is a tree without any nodes.\n22:raise ValueError(\"tree with no nodes\")\n23:```\n24:\n\nexercises/practice/sgf-parsing/.docs/instructions.md\n1:# Instructions\n2:\n3:Parsing a Smart Game Format string.\n4:\n5:[SGF][sgf] is a standard format for storing board game files, in particular go.\n6:\n7:SGF is a fairly simple format. An SGF file usually contains a single\n8:tree of nodes where each node is a property list. The property list\n9:contains key value pairs, each key can only occur once but may have\n10:multiple values.\n11:\n12:The exercise will have you parse an SGF string and return a tree structure of properties.\n13:\n14:An SGF file may look like this:\n15:\n16:```text\n17:(;FF[4]C[root]SZ[19];B[aa];W[ab])\n18:```\n19:\n20:This is a tree with three nodes:\n21:\n22:- The top level node has three properties: FF\\[4\\] (key = \"FF\", value\n23:  = \"4\"), C\\[root\\](key = \"C\", value = \"root\") and SZ\\[19\\] (key =\n24:  \"SZ\", value = \"19\"). (FF indicates the version of SGF, C is a\n25:  comment and SZ is the size of the board.)\n26:  - The top level node has a single child which has a single property:\n27:    B\\[aa\\]. (Black plays on the point encoded as \"aa\", which is the\n28:    1-1 point).\n29:    - The B\\[aa\\] node has a single child which has a single property:\n30:      W\\[ab\\].\n31:\n32:As you can imagine an SGF file contains a lot of nodes with a single\n33:child, which is why there's a shorthand for it.\n34:\n35:SGF can encode variations of play. Go players do a lot of backtracking\n36:in their reviews (let's try this, doesn't work, let's try that) and SGF\n37:supports variations of play sequences. For example:\n38:\n39:```text\n40:(;FF[4](;B[aa];W[ab])(;B[dd];W[ee]))\n41:```\n42:\n43:Here the root node has two variations. The first (which by convention\n44:indicates what's actually played) is where black plays on 1-1. Black was\n45:sent this file by his teacher who pointed out a more sensible play in\n46:the second child of the root node: `B[dd]` (4-4 point, a very standard\n47:opening to take the corner).\n48:\n49:A key can have multiple values associated with it. For example:\n50:\n51:```text\n52:(;FF[4];AB[aa][ab][ba])\n53:```\n54:\n55:Here `AB` (add black) is used to add three black stones to the board.\n56:\n57:All property values will be the [SGF Text type][sgf-text].\n58:You don't need to implement any other value type.\n59:Although you can read the [full documentation of the Text type][sgf-text], a summary of the important points is below:\n60:\n61:- Newlines are removed if they come immediately after a `\\`, otherwise they remain as newlines.\n62:- All whitespace characters other than newline are converted to spaces.\n63:- `\\` is the escape character.\n64:  Any non-whitespace character after `\\` is inserted as-is.\n65:  Any whitespace character after `\\` follows the above rules.\n66:  Note that SGF does **not** have escape sequences for whitespace characters such as `\\t` or `\\n`.\n67:\n68:Be careful not to get confused between:\n69:\n70:- The string as it is represented in a string literal in the tests\n71:- The string that is passed to the SGF parser\n72:\n73:Escape sequences in the string literals may have already been processed by the programming language's parser before they are passed to the SGF parser.\n74:\n75:There are a few more complexities to SGF (and parsing in general), which\n76:you can mostly ignore. You should assume that the input is encoded in\n77:UTF-8, the tests won't contain a charset property, so don't worry about\n78:that. Furthermore you may assume that all newlines are unix style (`\\n`,\n79:no `\\r` or `\\r\\n` will be in the tests) and that no optional whitespace\n80:between properties, nodes, etc will be in the tests.\n81:\n82:[sgf]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_Game_Format\n83:[sgf-text]: https://www.red-bean.com/sgf/sgf4.html#text\n84:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I apologize for the confusion.

When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is.\n23:This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging.\n24:For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types][error types], but should still include a meaningful message.\n25:\n26:This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement][raise] to \"throw\" a `ValueError` when a node value being `delete()`-ed is not found in the linked list.\n27:Additionally, an `IndexError` should be thrown if there are no nodes left to `pop()`.\n28:The tests will only pass if you both `raise` these `exceptions` and include messages with them.\n29:\n30:To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n31:\n32:```python\n33:# When the value passed to `delete()` is not found.\n34:if not found:\n35:    raise ValueError(\"Value not found\")\n36:\n37:```\n38:\n39:To raise an `IndexError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n40:\n41:```python\n42:# When pop() is called and there are no nodes left in the linked list\n43:if self.length == 0:\n44:    raise IndexError(\"List is empty\")\n45:\n46:```\n47:\n48:\n49:## Special Methods in Python\n50:\n51:The tests for this exercise will also be calling `len()` on your `LinkedList`.\n52:In order for `len()` to work, you will need to create a `__len__` special method.\n53:For details on implementing special or \"dunder\" methods in Python, see [Python Docs: Basic Object Customization][basic customization] and [Python Docs: object.__len__(self)][__len__].\n54:\n55:We also recommend creating a special [`__iter__`][__iter__] method to help with iterating over your linked list.\n56:\n57:<br>\n58:\n59:[__iter__]: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__iter__\n60:[__len__]: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__len__\n61:[basic customization]: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#basic-customization\n62:[error types]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes\n63:[raise]: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement\n64:[raising]: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions\n65:\n\nexercises/practice/linked-list/.docs/introduction.md\n1:# Introduction\n2:\n3:You are working on a project to develop a train scheduling system for a busy railway network.\n4:\n5:You've been asked to develop a prototype for the train routes in the scheduling system.\n6:Each route consists of a sequence of train stations that a given train stops at.\n7:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I will make the requested modifications to the linked_list.py file based on the instructions in exercises/practice/linked-list.\n\nSteps:\n1.

When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging.\n6:\n7:Custom exceptions can be created through new exception classes (see [`classes`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#tut-classes) for more detail.) that are typically subclasses of [`Exception`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception).\n8:\n9:For situations where you know the error source will be a derivative of a certain exception type, you can choose to inherit from one of the [`built in error types`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes) under the _Exception_ class. When raising the error, you should still include a meaningful message.\n10:\n11:This particular exercise requires that you create a _custom exception_ to be [raised](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement)/\"thrown\" when your `meetup()` function is given a weekday name and number combination that is invalid. The tests will only pass if you customize appropriate exceptions, `raise` those exceptions, and include appropriate error messages.\n12:\n13:To customize a `built-in exception`, create a `class` that inherits from that exception. When raising the custom exception with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n14:\n15:```python\n16:# subclassing the built-in ValueError to create MeetupDayException\n17:class MeetupDayException(ValueError):\n18:    \"\"\"Exception raised when the Meetup weekday and count do not result in a valid date.\n19:\n20:    message: explanation of the error.\n21:\n22:    \"\"\"\n23:    def __init__(self, message):\n24:        self.message = message\n25:\n26:        \n27:# raising a MeetupDayException\n28:raise MeetupDayException(\"That day does not exist.\")\n29:```\n30:\n\nexercises/practice/meetup/meetup.py\n1:# subclassing the built-in ValueError to create MeetupDayException\n2:class MeetupDayException(ValueError):\n3:    \"\"\"Exception raised when the Meetup weekday and count do not result in a valid date.\n4:\n5:    message: explanation of the error.\n6:\n7:    \"\"\"\n8:    def __init__(self):\n9:        pass\n10:\n11:\n12:def meetup(year, month, week, day_of_week):\n13:-    pass\n13:+    import calendar\n14:+    import datetime\n15:+\n16:+    # Get the weekday of the first day of the month\n17:+    first_day_weekday = calendar.weekday(year, month, 1)\n18:+\n19:+    # Get the weekday of the desired day_of_week\n20:+    desired_weekday = list(calendar.day_name).index(day_of_week)\n21:+\n22:+    # Calculate the offset to the desired day_of_week\n23:+    offset = (desired_weekday - first_day_weekday) % 7\n24:+\n25:+    # Calculate the day of the meetup\n26:+    if week == \"teenth\":\n27:+        day = offset + 13\n28:+    elif week == \"last\":\n29:+        last_day = calendar.monthrange(year, month)[1]\n30:+        day = last_day - (7 - offset) + 1\n31:+    else:\n32:+        day = offset + (int(week[0]) - 1) * 7 + 1\n33:+\n34:+    return datetime.date(year, month, day)\n35:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I will fix the ValueError in the meetup function to handle invalid week inputs.\n\nSteps:\n1.

zipper)\n17:- `up` (move the focus to the parent, returns a new zipper)\n18:- `set_value` (set the value of the focus node, returns a new zipper)\n19:- `insert_before` (insert a new subtree before the focus node, it\n20:  becomes the `prev` of the focus node, returns a new zipper)\n21:- `insert_after` (insert a new subtree after the focus node, it becomes\n22:  the `next` of the focus node, returns

This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. \n6:\n7:Custom exceptions can be created through new exception classes (see [`classes`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#tut-classes) for more detail.) that are typically subclasses of [`Exception`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception).\n8:\n9:For situations where you know the error source will be a derivative of a certain exception type, you can choose to inherit from one of the [`built in error types`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes) under the _Exception_ class. When raising the error, you should still include a meaningful message.\n10:\n11:This particular exercise requires that you create a _custom exception_ to be [raised](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement)/\"thrown\" when the stack is not sufficiently filled.

[`raise`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions) exceptions in your code. When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. \n6:\n7:Custom exceptions can be created through new exception classes (see [`classes`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#tut-classes) for more detail.) that are typically subclasses of [`Exception`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception).\n8:\n9:For situations where you know the error source will be a derivative of a certain exception type, you can choose to inherit from one of the [`built in error types`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes) under the _Exception_ class. When raising the error, you should still include a meaningful message.\n10:\n11:This particular exercise requires that you create two _custom exceptions_.  One exception to be [raised](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement)/\"thrown\" when your circular buffer is **full**, and one for when it is **empty**. The tests will only pass if you customize appropriate exceptions, `raise` those exceptions, and include appropriate error messages.\n12:\n13:To customize a `built-in exception`, create a `class` that inherits from that exception.

\"canonical\" implementation of a linked list in Python usually requires one or more `classes`.\n34:For a good introduction to `classes`, see the [concept:python/classes]() and companion exercise [exercise:python/ellens-alien-game](), or [Class section of the Official Python Tutorial][classes tutorial].\n35:\n36:<br>\n37:\n38:## Special Methods in Python\n39:\n40:The tests for this exercise will be calling `len()` on your `LinkedList`.\n41:In order for `len()` to work, you will need to create a `__len__` special method.\n42:For details on implementing special or \"dunder\" methods in Python, see [Python Docs: Basic Object Customization][basic customization] and [Python Docs: object.**len**(self)][__len__].\n43:\n44:<br>\n45:\n46:## Building an Iterator\n47:\n48:To support looping through or reversing your `LinkedList`, you will need to implement the `__iter__` special method.\n49:See [implementing an iterator for a class.][custom iterators] for implementation details.\n50:\n51:<br>\n52:\n53:## Customizing and Raising Exceptions\n54:\n55:Sometimes it is necessary to both [customize][customize errors] and [`raise`][raising exceptions] exceptions in your code.\n56:When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is.\n57:This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging.\n58:\n59:Custom exceptions can be created through new exception classes (see [`classes`][classes tutorial] for more detail.) that are typically subclasses of [`Exception`][exception base class].\n60:\n61:For situations where you know the error source will be a derivative of a certain exception _type_, you can choose to inherit from one of the [`built in error types`][built-in errors] under the _Exception_ class.\n62:When raising the error, you should still include a meaningful message.\n63:\n64:This particular exercise requires that you create a _custom exception_ to be [raised][raise statement]/\"thrown\" when your linked list is **empty**.\n65:The tests will only pass if you customize appropriate exceptions, `raise` those exceptions, and include appropriate error messages.\n66:\n67:To customize a generic _exception_, create a `class` that inherits from `Exception`.\n68:When raising the custom exception with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n69:\n70:```python\n71:# subclassing Exception to create EmptyListException\n72:class EmptyListException(Exception):\n73:    \"\"\"Exception raised when the linked list is

The top dotted arrow line is labeled \"push\" and points to Node_6, above and to the right.  Node_6 reads \"(current) head - Node_6 - next = node_5\". The bottom dotted arrow line is labeled \"pop\" and points to a box that reads \"gets removed on pop()\". Node_6 has a solid arrow that points rightward to Node_5, which reads \"Node_5 - next = node_4\". Node_5 has a solid arrow pointing rightward to Node_4, which reads \"Node_4 - next = node_3\".

\"canonical\" implementation of a linked list in Python usually requires one or more `classes`.\n34:For a good introduction to `classes`, see the [concept:python/classes]() and companion exercise [exercise:python/ellens-alien-game](), or [Class section of the Official Python Tutorial][classes tutorial].\n35:\n36:<br>\n37:\n38:## Special Methods in Python\n39:\n40:The tests for this exercise will be calling `len()` on your `LinkedList`.\n41:In order for `len()` to work, you will need to create a `__len__` special method.\n42:For details on implementing special or \"dunder\" methods in Python, see [Python Docs: Basic Object Customization][basic customization] and [Python Docs: object.**len**(self)][__len__].\n43:\n44:<br>\n45:\n46:## Building an Iterator\n47:\n48:To support looping through or reversing your `LinkedList`, you will need to implement the `__iter__` special method.\n49:See [implementing an iterator for a class.][custom iterators] for implementation details.\n50:\n51:<br>\n52:\n53:## Customizing and Raising Exceptions\n54:\n55:Sometimes it is necessary to both [customize][customize errors] and [`raise`][raising exceptions] exceptions in your code.\n56:When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is.\n57:This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging.\n58:\n59:Custom exceptions can be created through new exception classes (see [`classes`][classes tutorial] for more detail.) that are typically subclasses of [`Exception`][exception base class].\n60:\n61:For situations where you know the error source will be a derivative of a certain exception _type_, you can choose to inherit from one of the [`built in error types`][built-in errors] under the _Exception_ class.\n62:When raising the error, you should still include a meaningful message.\n63:\n64:This particular exercise requires that you create a _custom exception_ to be [raised][raise statement]/\"thrown\" when your linked list is **empty**.\n65:The tests will only pass if you customize appropriate exceptions, `raise` those exceptions, and include appropriate error messages.\n66:\n67:To customize a generic _exception_, create a `class` that inherits from `Exception`.\n68:When raising the custom exception with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n69:\n70:```python\n71:# subclassing Exception to create EmptyListException\n72:class EmptyListException(Exception):\n73:    \"\"\"Exception raised when the linked list is empty.\n74:\n75:    message: explanation of the error.\n76:\n77:    \"\"\"\n78:    def __init__(self, message):\n79:        self.message = message\n80:\n81:# raising an EmptyListException\n82:raise

so small in fact that if you printed the resistance value on them, it would be hard to read.\n8:  To get around this problem, manufacturers print color-coded bands onto the resistors to denote their resistance values.\n9:- Each band acts as a digit of a number.\n10:  For example, if they printed a brown band (value 1) followed by a green band (value 5), it would translate to the number 15.\n11:  In this exercise, you are going to create a helpful program so that you don't have to remember the values of the bands.\n12:  The program will take 3 colors as input, and outputs the correct value, in ohms.\n13:  The color bands are encoded as follows:\n14:\n15:- Black: 0\n16:- Brown: 1\n17:- Red: 2\n18:- Orange: 3\n19:- Yellow: 4\n20:- Green: 5\n21:- Blue: 6\n22:- Violet: 7\n23:- Grey: 8\n24:- White: 9\n25:\n26:In Resistor Color Duo you decoded the first two colors.\n27:For instance: orange-orange got the main value `33`.\n28:The third color stands for how many zeros need to be added to the main value.\n29:The main value plus the zeros gives us a value in ohms.\n30:For the exercise it doesn't matter what ohms really are.\n31:For example:\n32:\n33:- orange-orange-black would be 33 and no zeros, which becomes 33 ohms.\n34:- orange-orange-red would be 33 and 2 zeros, which becomes 3300 ohms.\n35:- orange-orange-orange would be 33 and 3 zeros, which becomes 33000 ohms.\n36:\n37:(If Math is your thing, you may want to think of the zeros as exponents of 10.\n38:If Math is not your thing, go with the zeros.\n39:It really is the same thing, just in plain English instead of Math lingo.)\n40:\n41:This exercise is about translating the colors into a label:\n42:\n43:> \"... ohms\"\n44:\n45:So an input of `\"orange\", \"orange\", \"black\"` should return:\n46:\n47:> \"33 ohms\"\n48:\n49:When we get to larger resistors, a [metric prefix][metric-prefix] is used to indicate a larger magnitude of ohms, such as \"kiloohms\".\n50:That is similar to saying \"2 kilometers\" instead of \"2000 meters\", or \"2 kilograms\" for \"2000 grams\".\n51:\n52:For example, an input of `\"orange\", \"orange\", \"orange\"` should return:\n53:\n54:> \"33 kiloohms\"\n55:\n56:[metric-prefix]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefix\n57:\n\nexercises/practice/resistor-color-trio/resistor_color_trio.py\n1:def label(colors):\n2:-    pass\n2:+    color_values = {\n3:+        \"black\": 0,\n4:+        \"brown\": 1,\n5:+        \"red\": 2,\n6:+        \"orange\": 3,\n7:+        \"yellow\": 4,\n8:+        \"green\": 5,\n9:+        \"blue\": 6,\n10:+        \"violet\": 7,\n11:+        \"grey\": 8,\n12:+        \"white\": 9\n13:+    }\n14:+    value = color_values[colors[0]] * 10 + color_values[colors[1]]\n15:+    zeros = \"0\" * color_values[colors[2]]\n16:+    magnitude = \"\"\n17:+    if value >= 1000:\n18:+        value /= 1000\n19:+        magnitude = \" kilo\"\n20:+    return f\"{int(value)}{zeros} ohms{magnitude}\"\n21:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I will fix the label function in resistor_color_trio.py to correctly handle the magnitude of ohms.\n\nSteps:\n1.

So if you only implement one of the two, it would be better to create a `__repr__` method.\n65:\n66:[repr-docs]: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__repr__\n67:[classes in python]: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html\n68:[REPL]: https://pythonprogramminglanguage.com/repl/\n69:[ISO 8601]: https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html\n70:\n71:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I will make the following modifications to the clock.py file:\n1.

Instructions\n2:\n3:Implement a clock that handles times without dates.\n4:\n5:You should be able to add and subtract minutes to it.\n6:\n7:Two clocks that represent the same time should be equal to each other.\n8:\n\nexercises/practice/clock/.docs/instructions.append.md\n1:# Instructions append\n2:\n3:The tests for this exercise expect your clock will be implemented via a Clock `class` in Python.\n4:If you are unfamiliar with classes in Python, [classes][classes in python] from the Python docs is a good place to start.\n5:## Representing your class\n6:\n7:When working with and debugging objects, it's important to have a string representation of that object.\n8:For example, if you were to create a new `datetime.datetime` object in the Python [REPL][REPL] environment, you could see its string representation:\n9:\n10:```python\n11:>>> from datetime import datetime\n12:>>> new_date = datetime(2022, 5, 4)\n13:>>> new_date\n14:datetime.datetime(2022, 5, 4, 0, 0)\n15:```\n16:\n17:Your Clock `class` will create a custom `object` that handles times without dates.\n18:One important aspect of this `class` will be how it is represented as a _string_.\n19:Other programmers who use or call Clock `objects` created from the Clock `class` will refer to this string representation for debugging and other activities.  \n20:However, the default string representation on a `class` is usually not very helpful.\n21:\n22:```python\n23:>>> Clock(12, 34)\n24:<Clock object st 0x102807b20 >\n25:```\n26:\n27:To create a more helpful representation, you can define a `__repr__` method on the `class` that returns a string.\n28:\n29:Ideally, the `__repr__` method returns valid Python code that can be used to recreate the object -- as laid out in the [specification for a `__repr__` method][repr-docs].\n30:Returning valid Python code allows you to copy-paste the `str` directly into code or the REPL.\n31:\n32:For example, a `Clock` that represents 11:30 AM could look like this: `Clock(11, 30)`.\n33:\n34:Defining a `__repr__` method is good practice for all classes.\n35:Some things to consider:\n36:\n37:- The information returned from this method should be beneficial when debugging issues.\n38:- _Ideally_, the method returns a string that is valid Python code -- although that might not always be possible.\n39:- If valid Python code is not practical, returning a description between angle brackets: `< ...a practical description... >` is the convention.\n40:\n41:\n42:### String conversion\n43:\n44:In addition to the `__repr__` method, there might also be a need for an alternative \"human-readable\" string representation of the `class`.\n45:This might be used to format the object for program output or documentation.\n46:Looking at `datetime.datetime` again:\n47:\n48:```python\n49:>>> str(datetime.datetime(2022, 5, 4))\n50:'2022-05-04 00:00:00'\n51:```\n52:\n53:When a `datetime` object is asked to convert itself to a string representation, it returns a `str` formatted according to the [ISO 8601 standard][ISO 8601], which can be parsed by most datetime libraries into a human-readable date and time.\n54:\n55:In this exercise, you will get a chance to write a `__str__` method, as well as a `__repr__`.\n56:\n57:```python\n58:>>> str(Clock(11, 30))\n59:'11:30'\n60:```\n61:\n62:To support this string conversion, you will need to create a `__str__` method on your class that returns a more \"human readable\" string showing the Clock time.\n63:\n64:If you don't create a `__str__` method and you call `str()` on your class, python will try calling `__repr__` on your class as a fallback. So if you only implement one of the two, it would be better to create a `__repr__` method.\n65:\n66:[repr-docs]: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__repr__\n67:[classes in python]: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html\n68:[REPL]: https://pythonprogramminglanguage.com/repl/\n69:[ISO 8601]: https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html\n70:\n71:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I will fix the AttributeError in the clock.py file by implementing the missing _get_hour and _get_minute methods.\n\nSteps:\n1.

both be zero at once.\n9:~~~~\n10:\n11:The absolute value `|r|` of the rational number `r = a/b` is equal to `|a|/|b|`.\n12:\n13:The sum of two rational numbers `r\u2081 = a\u2081/b\u2081` and `r\u2082 = a\u2082/b\u2082` is `r\u2081 + r\u2082 = a\u2081/b\u2081 + a\u2082/b\u2082 = (a\u2081 * b\u2082 + a\u2082 * b\u2081) / (b\u2081 * b\u2082)`.\n14:\n15:The difference of two rational numbers `r\u2081 = a\u2081/b\u2081` and `r\u2082 = a\u2082/b\u2082` is `r\u2081 - r\u2082 = a\u2081/b\u2081 - a\u2082/b\u2082 = (a\u2081 * b\u2082 - a\u2082 * b\u2081) / (b\u2081 * b\u2082)`.\n16:\n17:The product (multiplication) of two rational numbers `r\u2081 = a\u2081/b\u2081` and `r\u2082 = a\u2082/b\u2082` is `r\u2081 * r\u2082 = (a\u2081 * a\u2082) / (b\u2081 * b\u2082)`.\n18:\n19:Dividing a rational number `r\u2081 = a\u2081/b\u2081` by another `r\u2082 = a\u2082/b\u2082` is `r\u2081 / r\u2082 = (a\u2081 * b\u2082) / (a\u2082 * b\u2081)` if `a\u2082` is not zero.\n20:\n21:Exponentiation of a rational number `r = a/b` to a non-negative integer power `n` is `r^n = (a^n)/(b^n)`.\n22:\n23:Exponentiation of a rational number `r = a/b` to a negative integer power `n` is `r^n = (b^m)/(a^m)`, where `m = |n|`.\n24:\n25:Exponentiation of a rational number `r = a/b` to a real (floating-point) number `x` is the quotient `(a^x)/(b^x)`, which is a real number.\n26:\n27:Exponentiation of a real number `x` to a rational number `r = a/b` is `x^(a/b) = root(x^a, b)`, where `root(p, q)` is the `q`th root of `p`.\n28:\n29:Implement the following operations:\n30:\n31:- addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two rational numbers,\n32:- absolute value, exponentiation of a given rational number to an integer power, exponentiation of a given rational number to a real (floating-point) power, exponentiation of a real number to a rational number.\n33:\n34:Your implementation of rational numbers should always be reduced to lowest terms.\n35:For example, `4/4` should reduce to `1/1`, `30/60` should reduce to `1/2`, `12/8` should reduce to `3/2`, etc.\n36:To reduce a rational number `r = a/b`, divide `a` and `b` by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`.\n37:So, for example, `gcd(12, 8) = 4`, so `r = 12/8` can be reduced to `(12/4)/(8/4) = 3/2`.\n38:The reduced form of a rational number should be in \"standard form\" (the denominator should always be a positive integer).\n39:If a denominator with a negative integer is present, multiply both numerator and denominator by `-1` to ensure standard form is reached.\n40:For example, `3/-4` should be reduced to `-3/4`\n41:\n42:Assume that the programming language you are using does not have an implementation of rational numbers.\n43:\n"}, {"role":
