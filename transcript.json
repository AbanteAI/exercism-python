music are based on the chromatic (12-note) scale.\n6:This scale can be expressed as the following group of pitches:\n7:\n8:> A, A\u266f, B, C, C\u266f, D, D\u266f, E, F, F\u266f, G, G\u266f\n9:\n10:A

C, D\u266d, D, E\u266d, E, F, G\u266d, G, A\u266d\n13:\n14:The major and minor scale and modes are subsets of this twelve-pitch collection.\n15:They have seven pitches, and are called diatonic scales.\n16:The collection of notes in these scales is written with either sharps or flats, depending on the tonic (starting note).\n17:Here is a table indicating whether the flat expression or sharp expression of the scale would be used for a given tonic:\n18:\n19:| Key Signature | Major                 | Minor                |\n20:| ------------- | --------------------- | --------------------

the flats scale when descending.\n26:For the scope of this exercise the scale is only ascending.\n27:\n28:### Task\n29:\n30:Given a tonic, generate the 12 note chromatic scale starting with the tonic.\n31:\n32:- Shift the base scale appropriately so that all 12 notes are returned starting with the given tonic.\n33:- For the given tonic, determine if the scale is to be returned with flats or sharps.\n34:- Return all notes in uppercase letters (except for the `b` for flats) irrespective of the casing of the given tonic.\n35:\n36:## Diatonic Scales\n37:\n38:The diatonic scales, and all other scales that derive from the chromatic scale, are built upon intervals.\n39:An interval is the space between two pitches.\n40:\n41:The simplest interval is between two adjacent notes, and is called a \"half step\", or \"minor second\" (sometimes written as a lower-case \"m\").\n42:The interval between two notes that have an interceding note is called a \"whole step\" or \"major second\" (written as an upper-case \"M\").\n43:The diatonic scales are built using only these two intervals between adjacent notes.\n44:\n45:Non-diatonic scales can contain other intervals.\n46:An \"augmented second\" interval, written \"A\", has two interceding notes (e.g., from A to C or D\u266d to E) or a \"whole step\" plus a \"half step\".\n47:There are also smaller and larger intervals, but they will not figure into this exercise.\n48:\n49:### Task\n50:\n51:Given a tonic and a set of intervals, generate the musical scale starting with the tonic and following the specified interval pattern.\n52:\n53:This is similar to generating chromatic scales except that instead of returning 12 notes, you will return N+1 notes for N intervals.\n54:The first note is always the given tonic.\n55:Then, for each interval in the pattern, the next note is determined by starting from the previous note and skipping the number of notes indicated by the interval.\n56:\n57:For example, starting with G and using the seven intervals MMmMMMm, there would be the following eight notes:\n58:\n59:| Note | Reason                                            |\n60:| ---- |

An SGF file usually contains a single\n8:tree of nodes where each node is a property list. The property list\n9:contains key value pairs, each key can only occur once but may have\n10:multiple values.\n11:\n12:The exercise will have you parse an SGF string and return a tree structure of properties.\n13:\n14:An SGF file may look like this:\n15:\n16:```text\n17:(;FF[4]C[root]SZ[19];B[aa];W[ab])\n18:```\n19:\n20:This is a tree with three nodes:\n21:\n22:- The top level node has three properties: FF\\[4\\] (key = \"FF\", value\n23:  = \"4\"), C\\[root\\](key = \"C\", value = \"root\") and SZ\\[19\\] (key =\n24:  \"SZ\", value = \"19\"). (FF indicates the version of SGF, C is a\n25:  comment and SZ is the size of the board.)\n26:  - The top level node has a single child which has a single property:\n27:    B\\[aa\\]. (Black plays on the point encoded as \"aa\", which is the\n28:    1-1 point).\n29:    - The B\\[aa\\] node has a single child which has a single property:\n30:      W\\[ab\\].\n31:\n32:As you can imagine an SGF file contains a lot of nodes with a single\n33:child, which is why there's a shorthand for it.\n34:\n35:SGF can encode variations of play. Go players do a lot of backtracking\n36:in their reviews (let's try this, doesn't work, let's try that) and SGF\n37:supports variations of play sequences. For example:\n38:\n39:```text\n40:(;FF[4](;B[aa];W[ab])(;B[dd];W[ee]))\n41:```\n42:\n43:Here the root node has two variations. The first (which by convention\n44:indicates what's actually played) is where black plays on 1-1. Black was\n45:sent this file by his teacher who pointed out a more sensible play in\n46:the second child of the root node: `B[dd]` (4-4 point, a very standard\n47:opening to take the corner).\n48:\n49:A key can have multiple values associated with it. For example:\n50:\n51:```text\n52:(;FF[4];AB[aa][ab][ba])\n53:```\n54:\n55:Here `AB` (add black) is used to add three black stones to the board.\n56:\n57:All property values will be the [SGF Text type][sgf-text].\n58:You don't need to implement any other value type.\n59:Although you can read the [full documentation of the Text type][sgf-text], a summary of the important points is below:\n60:\n61:- Newlines are removed if they come immediately after a `\\`, otherwise they remain as newlines.\n62:- All whitespace characters other than newline are converted to spaces.\n63:- `\\` is the escape character.\n64:  Any non-whitespace character after `\\` is inserted as-is.\n65:  Any whitespace character after `\\` follows the above rules.\n66:  Note that SGF does **not** have escape sequences for whitespace characters such as `\\t` or `\\n`.\n67:\n68:Be careful not to get confused between:\n69:\n70:- The string as it is represented in a string literal in the tests\n71:- The string that is passed to the SGF parser\n72:\n73:Escape sequences in the string literals may have already been processed by the programming language's parser before they are passed to the SGF parser.\n74:\n75:There are a few more complexities to SGF (and parsing in general), which\n76:you can mostly ignore. You should assume that the input is encoded in\n77:UTF-8, the tests won't contain a charset property, so don't worry about\n78:that. Furthermore you may assume that all newlines are unix style (`\\n`,\n79:no `\\r` or `\\r\\n` will be in the tests) and that no optional whitespace\n80:between properties, nodes, etc will be in the tests.\n81:\n82:[sgf]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_Game_Format\n83:[sgf-text]: https://www.red-bean.com/sgf/sgf4.html#text\n84:\n\nexercises/practice/sgf-parsing/sgf_parsing.py\n1:class SgfTree:\n2:    def __init__(self, properties=None, children=None):\n3:        self.properties = properties or {}\n4:        self.children = children or []\n5:\n6:    def __eq__(self, other):\n7:        if not isinstance(other, SgfTree):\n8:            return False\n9:        for key, value in self.properties.items():\n10:            if key not in other.properties:\n11:                return False\n12:            if other.properties[key] != value:\n13:                return False\n14:        for key in other.properties.keys():\n15:            if key not in self.properties:\n16:                return False\n17:        if len(self.children) != len(other.children):\n18:            return False\n19:        for child, other_child in zip(self.children, other.children):\n20:            if child != other_child:\n21:                return False\n22:        return True\n23:\n24:    def __ne__(self, other):\n25:        return not self == other\n26:\n27:\n28:def parse(input_string):\n29:    pass\n30:\n\nexercises/practice/sgf-parsing/.docs/instructions.append.md\n1:# Instructions append\n2:\n3:## Exception messages\n4:\n5:Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions).

(Black plays on the point encoded as \"aa\", which is the\n28:    1-1 point).\n29:    - The B\\[aa\\] node has a single child which has a single property:\n30:      W\\[ab\\].\n31:\n32:As you can imagine an SGF file contains a lot of nodes with a single\n33:child, which is why there's a shorthand for it.\n34:\n35:SGF can encode variations of play. Go players do a lot of backtracking\n36:in their reviews (let's try this, doesn't work, let's try that) and SGF\n37:supports variations of play sequences. For example:\n38:\n39:```text\n40:(;FF[4](;B[aa];W[ab])(;B[dd];W[ee]))\n41:```\n42:\n43:Here the root node has two variations. The first (which by convention\n44:indicates what's actually played) is where black plays on 1-1. Black was\n45:sent this file by his teacher who pointed out a more sensible play in\n46:the second child of the root node: `B[dd]` (4-4 point, a very standard\n47:opening to take the corner).\n48:\n49:A key can have multiple values associated with it. For example:\n50:\n51:```text\n52:(;FF[4];AB[aa][ab][ba])\n53:```\n54:\n55:Here `AB` (add black) is used to add three black stones to the board.\n56:\n57:All property values will be the [SGF Text type][sgf-text].\n58:You don't need to implement any other value type.\n59:Although you can read the [full documentation of the Text type][sgf-text], a summary of the important points is below:\n60:\n61:- Newlines are removed if they come immediately after a `\\`, otherwise they remain as newlines.\n62:- All whitespace characters other than newline are converted to spaces.\n63:- `\\` is the escape character.\n64:  Any non-whitespace character after `\\` is inserted as-is.\n65:  Any whitespace character after `\\` follows the above rules.\n66:  Note that SGF does **not** have escape sequences for whitespace characters such as `\\t` or `\\n`.\n67:\n68:Be careful not to get confused between:\n69:\n70:- The string as it is represented in a string literal in the tests\n71:- The string that is passed to the SGF parser\n72:\n73:Escape sequences in the string literals may have already been processed by the programming language's parser before they are passed to the SGF parser.\n74:\n75:There are a few more complexities to SGF (and parsing in general), which\n76:you can mostly ignore. You should assume that the input is encoded in\n77:UTF-8, the tests won't contain a charset property, so don't worry about\n78:that. Furthermore you may assume that all newlines are unix style (`\\n`,\n79:no `\\r` or `\\r\\n` will be in the tests) and that no optional whitespace\n80:between properties, nodes, etc will be in the tests.\n81:\n82:[sgf]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_Game_Format\n83:[sgf-text]: https://www.red-bean.com/sgf/sgf4.html#text\n84:\n\nexercises/practice/sgf-parsing/sgf_parsing.py\n1:class SgfTree:\n2:    def __init__(self, properties=None, children=None):\n3:        self.properties = properties or {}\n4:        self.children = children or []\n5:\n6:    def __eq__(self, other):\n7:        if not isinstance(other, SgfTree):\n8:            return False\n9:        for key, value in self.properties.items():\n10:            if key not in other.properties:\n11:                return False\n12:            if other.properties[key] != value:\n13:                return False\n14:        for key in other.properties.keys():\n15:            if key not in self.properties:\n16:                return False\n17:        if len(self.children) != len(other.children):\n18:            return False\n19:        for child, other_child in zip(self.children, other.children):\n20:            if child != other_child:\n21:                return False\n22:        return True\n23:\n24:    def __ne__(self, other):\n25:        return not self == other\n26:\n27:\n28:def parse(input_string):\n29:-    pass\n29:+    if not input_string.startswith('(') or not input_string.endswith(')'):\n30:+        raise ValueError(\"input is not a tree\")\n31:+    \n32:+    input_string = input_string[1:-1]\n33:+    properties, children = parse_node(input_string)\n34:+    return SgfTree(properties, children)\n35:+\n36:+def parse_node(input_string):\n37:+    properties = {}\n38:+    children = []\n39:+    while input_string:\n40:+        if input_string[0] == '(':\n41:+            child, input_string = parse_node(input_string[1:])\n42:+            children.append(child)\n43:+        elif input_string[0] == ')':\n44:+            return properties, children\n45:+        else:\n46:+            key, input_string = parse_property(input_string)\n47:+            values, input_string = parse_values(input_string)\n48:+            properties[key] = values\n49:+\n50:+    raise ValueError(\"input is not a tree\")\n51:+\n52:+def parse_property(input_string):\n53:+    if not input_string.startswith(';'):\n54:+        raise ValueError(\"property missing\")\n55:+    \n56:+    input_string = input_string[1:]\n57:+    key, input_string = parse_key(input_string)\n58:+    return key, input_string\n59:+\n60:+def parse_key(input_string):\n61:+    if not input_string:\n62:+        raise ValueError(\"property key missing\")\n63:+    \n64:+    key = \"\"\n65:+    while input_string and input_string[0].isalpha():\n66:+        key += input_string[0]\n67:+        input_string = input_string[1:]\n68:+    \n69:+    if not key.isupper():\n70:+        raise ValueError(\"property must be in uppercase\")\n71:+    \n72:+    return key, input_string\n73:+\n74:+def parse_values(input_string):\n75:+    if not input_string.startswith('['):\n76:+        raise ValueError(\"property values missing\")\n77:+    \n78:+    input_string = input_string[1:]\n79:+    values, input_string = parse_value(input_string)\n80:+    return values, input_string\n81:+\n82:+def parse_value(input_string):\n83:+    if not input_string:\n84:+        raise ValueError(\"property value missing\")\n85:+    \n86:+    value = \"\"\n87:+    while input_string:\n88:+        if input_string[0] == ']':\n89:+            return value, input_string[1:]\n90:+        elif input_string[0] == '\\\\':\n91:+            value += input_string[1]\n92:+            input_string = input_string[2:]\n93:+        else:\n94:+            value += input_string[0]\n95:+            input_string = input_string[1:]\n96:+    \n97:+    raise ValueError(\"property value missing\")\n98:+\n99:\n\nexercises/practice/sgf-parsing/.docs/instructions.append.md\n1:# Instructions append\n2:\n3:## Exception messages\n4:\n5:Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions).

network.\n4:\n5:You've been asked to develop a prototype for the train routes in the scheduling system.\n6:Each route consists of a sequence of train stations that a given train stops at.\n7:\n\nexercises/practice/linked-list/.docs/instructions.md\n1:# Instructions\n2:\n3:Your team has decided to use a doubly linked list to represent each train route in the schedule.\n4:Each station along the train's route will be represented by a node in the linked list.\n5:\n6:You don't need to worry about arrival and departure times at the stations.\n7:Each station will simply be represented by a number.\n8:\n9:Routes can be extended, adding stations to the beginning or end of a route.\n10:They can also be shortened by removing stations from the beginning or the end of a route.\n11:\n12:Sometimes a station gets closed down, and in that case the station needs to be removed from the route, even if it is not at the beginning or end of the route.\n13:\n14:The size of a route is measured not by how far the train travels, but by how many stations it stops at.\n15:\n16:~~~~exercism/note\n17:The linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science, often used in the implementation of other data structures.\n18:As the name suggests, it is a list of nodes that are linked together.\n19:It is a list of \"nodes\", where each node links to its neighbor or neighbors.\n20:In a **singly linked list** each node links only to the node that follows it.\n21:In a **doubly linked list** each node links to both the node that comes before, as well as the node that comes after.\n22:\n23:If you want to dig deeper into linked lists, check out [this article][intro-linked-list] that explains it using nice drawings.\n24:\n25:[intro-linked-list]:

Exercise is Structured in Python\n4:\n5:While linked lists can be implemented in a variety of ways with a variety of underlying data structures, we ask here that you implement your linked list in an OOP fashion.\n6:\n7:In the stub file, you will see the start of a `Node` class, as well as a `LinkedList` class.\n8:Your `Node` class should keep track of its value, as well as which other nodes preceed or follow.\n9:Your `push`, `pop`, `shift`, `unshift`, and the special method for `len` should be implemented in the `LinkedList` class.\n10:You might also find it useful to implement a special `iter` method for iteration.\n11:\n12:Unlike the core exercise, we will be testing error conditions by calling `pop` and `shift` on empty `LinkedLists`, so you will need to `raise` errors appropriately.\n13:\n14:Finally, we would like you to implement `delete` in addition to the methods outlined above.\n15:`delete` will take one argument, which is the value to be removed from the linked list.\n16:If the value appears more than once, only the **first** occurrence should be removed.\n17:\n18:<br>\n19:\n20:## Exception messages\n21:\n22:Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an

\"canonical\" implementation of a linked list in Python usually requires one or more `classes`.\n34:For a good introduction to `classes`, see the [concept:python/classes]() and companion exercise [exercise:python/ellens-alien-game](), or [Class section of the Official Python Tutorial][classes tutorial].\n35:\n36:<br>\n37:\n38:## Special Methods in Python\n39:\n40:The tests for this exercise will be calling `len()` on your `LinkedList`.\n41:In order for `len()` to work, you will need to create a `__len__` special method.\n42:For details on implementing special or \"dunder\" methods in Python, see [Python Docs: Basic Object Customization][basic customization] and [Python Docs: object.**len**(self)][__len__].\n43:\n44:<br>\n45:\n46:## Building an Iterator\n47:\n48:To support looping through or reversing your `LinkedList`, you will need to implement the `__iter__` special method.\n49:See [implementing an iterator for a class.][custom iterators] for implementation details.\n50:\n51:<br>\n52:\n53:## Customizing and Raising Exceptions\n54:\n55:Sometimes it is necessary to both [customize][customize errors] and [`raise`][raising exceptions] exceptions in your code.\n56:When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is.\n57:This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging.\n58:\n59:Custom exceptions can be created through new exception classes (see [`classes`][classes tutorial] for more detail.) that are typically subclasses of [`Exception`][exception base class].\n60:\n61:For situations where you know the error source will be a derivative of a certain exception _type_, you can choose to inherit from one of the [`built in error types`][built-in errors] under the _Exception_ class.\n62:When raising the error, you should still include a meaningful message.\n63:\n64:This particular exercise requires that you create a _custom exception_ to be [raised][raise statement]/\"thrown\" when your linked list is **empty**.\n65:The tests will only pass if you customize appropriate exceptions, `raise` those exceptions, and include appropriate error messages.\n66:\n67:To customize a generic _exception_, create a `class` that inherits from `Exception`.\n68:When raising the custom exception with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n69:\n70:```python\n71:# subclassing Exception to create EmptyListException\n72:class EmptyListException(Exception):\n73:    \"\"\"Exception raised when the linked list is empty.\n74:\n75:    message: explanation of the error.\n76:\n77:    \"\"\"\n78:    def __init__(self, message):\n79:        self.message = message\n80:\n81:# raising an EmptyListException\n82:raise

`multiprocessing.Queue`, this exercise expects a [\"Last in, First Out\" (`LIFO`) stack][baeldung: the stack data structure] using a _custom-made_ [singly linked list][singly linked list]:\n6:\n7:<br>\n8:\n9:![Diagram representing a stack implemented with a linked list. A circle with a dashed border named New_Node is to the far left-hand side, with two dotted arrow lines pointing right-ward.  New_Node reads \"(becomes head) - New_Node - next = node_6\". The top dotted arrow line is labeled \"push\" and points to Node_6, above and to the right.  Node_6 reads \"(current) head - Node_6 - next = node_5\". The bottom dotted arrow line is labeled \"pop\" and points to a box that reads \"gets removed on pop()\". Node_6 has a solid arrow that points rightward to Node_5, which reads \"Node_5 - next = node_4\". Node_5 has a solid arrow pointing rightward to Node_4, which reads \"Node_4 - next = node_3\". This pattern continues until Node_1, which reads \"(current) tail - Node_1 - next = None\". Node_1 has a dotted arrow pointing rightward to a node that says \"None\".](https://assets.exercism.org/images/tracks/python/simple-linked-list/linked-list.svg)\n10:\n11:<br>\n12:\n13:This should not be confused with a [`LIFO` stack using a dynamic array or list][lifo stack array], which may use a `list`, `queue`, or `array` underneath.\n14:Dynamic array based `stacks` have a different `head` position and different time complexity (Big-O) and memory footprint.\n15:\n16:<br>\n17:\n18:![Diagram representing a stack implemented with an array/dynamic array. A box with a dashed border named New_Node is to the far right-hand side, with two dotted arrow lines pointing left-ward.  New_Node reads \"(becomes head) -  New_Node\". The top dotted arrow line is labeled \"append\" and points to Node_6, above and to the left.  Node_6 reads \"(current) head - Node_6\". The bottom dotted arrow line is labeled \"pop\" and points to a box with a dotted outline that reads \"gets removed on pop()\". Node_6 has a solid arrow that points leftward to Node_5. Node_5 has a solid arrow pointing leftward to Node_4. This pattern continues until Node_1, which reads \"(current) tail - Node_1\".](https://assets.exercism.org/images/tracks/python/simple-linked-list/linked_list_array.svg)\n19:\n20:<br>\n21:\n22:See these two Stack Overflow questions for some considerations: [Array-Based vs List-Based Stacks and Queues][stack overflow: array-based vs list-based stacks and queues] and [Differences between Array Stack, Linked Stack, and Stack][stack overflow: what is the difference between array stack, linked stack, and stack].\n23:For more details on linked lists, `LIFO` stacks, and other abstract data types (`ADT`) in Python:\n24:\n25:- [Baeldung: Linked-list Data Structures][baeldung linked lists] (_covers multiple implementations_)\n26:- [Geeks for Geeks: Stack with Linked List][geeks for geeks stack with linked list]\n27:- [Mosh on Abstract Data Structures][mosh data structures in python] (_covers many `ADT`s, not just linked lists_)\n28:\n29:<br>\n30:\n31:## Classes in Python\n32:\n33:The \"canonical\" implementation of a linked list in Python usually requires one or more `classes`.\n34:For a good introduction to `classes`, see the [concept:python/classes]() and companion exercise [exercise:python/ellens-alien-game](), or [Class section of the Official Python Tutorial][classes tutorial].\n35:\n36:<br>\n37:\n38:## Special Methods in Python\n39:\n40:The tests for this exercise will be calling `len()` on your `LinkedList`.\n41:In order for `len()` to work, you will need to create a `__len__` special method.\n42:For details on implementing special or \"dunder\" methods in Python, see [Python Docs: Basic Object Customization][basic customization] and [Python Docs: object.**len**(self)][__len__].\n43:\n44:<br>\n45:\n46:## Building an Iterator\n47:\n48:To support looping through or reversing your `LinkedList`, you will need to implement the `__iter__` special method.\n49:See [implementing an iterator for a class.][custom iterators] for implementation details.\n50:\n51:<br>\n52:\n53:## Customizing and Raising Exceptions\n54:\n55:Sometimes it is necessary to both [customize][customize errors] and [`raise`][raising exceptions] exceptions in your code.\n56:When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is.\n57:This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging.\n58:\n59:Custom exceptions can be created through new exception classes (see [`classes`][classes tutorial] for more detail.) that are typically subclasses of [`Exception`][exception base class].\n60:\n61:For situations where you know the error source will be a derivative of a certain exception _type_, you can choose to inherit from one of the [`built in error types`][built-in errors] under the _Exception_ class.\n62:When raising the error, you should still include a meaningful message.\n63:\n64:This particular exercise requires that you create a _custom exception_ to be [raised][raise statement]/\"thrown\" when your linked list is **empty**.\n65:The tests will only pass if you customize appropriate exceptions, `raise` those exceptions, and include appropriate error messages.\n66:\n67:To customize a generic _exception_, create a `class` that inherits from `Exception`.\n68:When raising the custom exception with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n69:\n70:```python\n71:# subclassing Exception to create EmptyListException\n72:class EmptyListException(Exception):\n73:    \"\"\"Exception raised when the linked list is empty.\n74:\n75:    message: explanation of the error.\n76:\n77:    \"\"\"\n78:    def __init__(self, message):\n79:        self.message = message\n80:\n81:# raising an EmptyListException\n82:raise

to decipher these, and get at their meaning, he must substitute the fourth letter of the alphabet, namely D, for A, and so with the others.\"\n9:\u2014Suetonius, Life of Julius Caesar\n10:\n11:Ciphers are very straight-forward algorithms that allow us to render text less readable while still allowing easy deciphering.\n12:They are vulnerable to many forms of cryptanalysis, but Caesar was lucky that his enemies were not cryptanalysts.\n13:\n14:The Caesar Cipher was used for some messages from Julius Caesar that were sent afield.\n15:Now Caesar knew that the cipher wasn't very good, but he had one ally in that respect: almost nobody could read well.\n16:So even being a couple letters off was sufficient so that people couldn't recognize the few words that they did know.\n17:\n18:Your task is to create a simple shift cipher like the Caesar Cipher.\n19:This image is a great example of the Caesar Cipher:\n20:\n21:![Caesar Cipher][img-caesar-cipher]\n22:\n23:For example:\n24:\n25:Giving \"iamapandabear\" as input to the encode function returns the cipher \"ldpdsdqgdehdu\".\n26:Obscure enough to keep our message secret in transit.\n27:\n28:When \"ldpdsdqgdehdu\" is put into the decode function it would return the original \"iamapandabear\" letting your friend read your original message.\n29:\n30:## Step 2\n31:\n32:Shift ciphers quickly cease to be useful when the opposition commander figures them out.\n33:So instead, let's try using a substitution cipher.\n34:Try amending the code to allow us to specify a key and use that for the shift distance.\n35:\n36:Here's an example:\n37:\n38:Given the key \"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\", encoding the string \"iamapandabear\"\n39:would return the original \"iamapandabear\".\n40:\n41:Given the key \"ddddddddddddddddd\", encoding our string \"iamapandabear\"\n42:would return the obscured \"ldpdsdqgdehdu\"\n43:\n44:In the example above, we've set a = 0 for the key value.\n45:So when the plaintext is added to the key, we end up with the same message coming out.\n46:So \"aaaa\" is not an ideal key.\n47:But if we set the key to \"dddd\", we would get the same thing as the Caesar Cipher.\n48:\n49:## Step 3\n50:\n51:The weakest link in any cipher is the human being.\n52:Let's make your substitution cipher a little more fault tolerant by providing a source of randomness and ensuring that the key contains only lowercase letters.\n53:\n54:If someone doesn't submit a key at all, generate a truly random key of at least 100 lowercase characters in length.\n55:\n56:## Extensions\n57:\n58:Shift ciphers work by making the text slightly odd, but are vulnerable to frequency analysis.\n59:Substitution ciphers help that, but are still very vulnerable when the key is short or if spaces are preserved.\n60:Later on you'll see

Instructions\n2:\n3:Reparent a tree on a selected node.\n4:\n5:A [tree][wiki-tree] is a special type of [graph][wiki-graph] where all nodes are connected but there are no cycles.\n6:That means, there is exactly one path to get from one node to another for any pair of nodes.\n7:\n8:This exercise is all about re-orientating a tree to see things from a different point of view.\n9:For example family trees are usually presented from the ancestor's perspective:\n10:\n11:```text\n12:    +------0------+\n13:    |      |      |\n14:  +-1-+  +-2-+  +-3-+\n15:  |   |  |   |  |   |\n16:  4   5  6   7  8   9\n17:```\n18:\n19:But there is no inherent direction in a tree.\n20:The same information can be presented from the perspective of any other node in the tree, by pulling it up to the root and dragging its relationships along with it.\n21:So the same tree from 6's perspective would look like:\n22:\n23:```text\n24:        6\n25:        |\n26:  +-----2-----+\n27:  |           |\n28:  7     +-----0-----+\n29:        |           |\n30:      +-1-+       +-3-+\n31:      |   |       |   |\n32:      4   5       8   9\n33:```\n34:\n35:This lets us more simply describe the paths between two nodes.\n36:So for example the path from 6-9 (which in the first tree goes up to the root and then down to a different leaf node) can be seen to follow the path 6-2-0-3-9.\n37:\n38:This exercise involves taking an input tree and re-orientating it from the point of view of one of the nodes.\n39:\n40:[wiki-graph]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)\n41:[wiki-tree]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)\n42:\n\nexercises/practice/pov/.docs/instructions.append.md\n1:# Instructions append\n2:\n3:## Exception messages\n4:\n5:Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.\n6:\n7:This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to \"throw\" multiple `ValueErrors` if the `Tree()` class is passed a tree that cannot be reoriented, or a path cannot be found between a `start node` and an `end node`. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.\n8:\n9:To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n10:\n11:```python\n12:# when a tree cannot be oriented to a new node POV\n13:raise ValueError(\"Tree could not be reoriented\")\n14:\n15:#when a path cannot be found between a start and end node on the tree.\n16:raise ValueError(\"No path found\")\n17:```\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I apologize for the mistake in the implementation.
