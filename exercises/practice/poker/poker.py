# Note: The rank_hand function is a placeholder and needs to be fully implemented
# with the logic to parse and rank each hand according to poker rules.
# The current implementation of best_hands assumes that rank_hand returns an integer
# representing the rank of the hand, where a higher number indicates a better hand.
# The actual hand ranking logic will be complex and is not shown here due to brevity.
# It will involve parsing the hand, determining if it meets the criteria for each
# hand rank (e.g., flush, straight, etc.), and returning the appropriate rank value.
# The implementation will also need to handle tie-breaking scenarios.
# This is a simplified representation to illustrate the required changes.
# The full implementation would require additional code to accurately rank each hand.
