# Note: The implementation assumes that 'y' is treated as a vowel when it appears after a consonant cluster or as the second letter in a two-letter word. This is a simplification of Rule 4 and may need refinement based on the actual test cases.
# The implementation also assumes that 'qu' is treated as a single consonant sound for the purposes of Rule 3.
# Edge cases and regional variants are not covered in this implementation and should be addressed if specified in the test cases.
# The function uses a generator expression to apply the translation to each word in the input text, which is split into words based on spaces.
# The function `is_vowel_sound` checks for vowel sounds at the beginning of the word, including special cases "xr" and "yt".
# The function `is_consonant_sound` is a helper that returns the opposite of `is_vowel_sound`.
# The function `translate_word` applies the rules to translate a single word into Pig Latin.
# The main `translate` function joins the translated words back into a single string with spaces.
