def translate(text):
    # Rule 1: If a word begins with a vowel sound, add an "ay" sound to the end of the word.
    # Rule 2: If a word begins with a consonant sound, move it to the end of the word and then add an "ay" sound to the end of the word.
    # Rule 3: If a word starts with a consonant sound followed by "qu", move it to the end of the word, and then add an "ay" sound to the end of the word.
    # Rule 4: If a word contains a "y" after a consonant cluster or as the second letter in a two-letter word, it makes a vowel sound.
